# Dropdown Menus

Pop-out menus generated with JQuery from ordinary hyperlinks.

I wanted to take a stab at writing my own drop-down menu script using only JQuery, and without using a commercial third-party menu library.

View the JQuery [code](dropdown-menu.js).

View the [web page](http://joelrecinos.com/jquery-menu.htm) in action.
